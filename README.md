Collection of playbooks that are easy to use and can spark ideas for your own playbooks.  
I started writing these to document the processes and mindset I used to solve CTF challenges.  
The playbooks are very simple on purpose to give you room to modify them and make them better.  

*I created these using Jupyter Notebook to give me the flexibility of storing code snippets.*
